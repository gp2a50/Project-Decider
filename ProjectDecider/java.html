        <h1>Top 7 Java Project Ideas To Enhance Programming Skills</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="java">
        <p>If we particularly talk about JAVA, the language has a lot more to explore when it comes to building projects. The object-oriented language follows the WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) concept i.e. the compiled JAVA code can run on any platform compatible with the language without doing recompilation. The language is used in a wide array of project development such as Web Applications, Android Applications, Desktop Applications, Scientific Applications, Software Tools, Games, and various others. <br>
            When it comes to working on real-world projects in JAVA, you’re recommended to opt for either Eclipse or NetBeans as your JAVA IDE due to their ease to use functionalities. Although, you can use several other IDEs as well such as Blue J, JDeveloper, etc. as per your requirements and convenience. Now, without wasting much time, let’s take a look at 7 best JAVA project ideas that can help you to advance your programming skills:
